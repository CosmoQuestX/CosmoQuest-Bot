// Botkit is powered by "skills". For example this one is "hears"

// Basically the bot listens to to direct mentions and mentions (of the bot)

// and if it hears the word "!thanks" then the skill is triggered

// try changing the trigger word 

// here are the docs for more info https://botkit.ai/docs/v0/core.html

// and the Botkit Discord code which has some great examples! 

// https://github.com/brh55/botkit-discord

module.exports = function(controller) {

  controller.hears("!thanks", ["direct_mention", "mention"], (bot, message) => {

    let response;

    let sender = message.user;

    

    // Many bots use the this method but sometimes it doesn't work, for example if you mention more than one person

    //let recipient = message.mentions.users.last();

    

    

    // this method filters out any users that aren't bots

    // if you have a bot that does more administrative things like blocking people, you might want to filter even more

    // like filter out admins or the person sending the message

    // it's using Discord.js for all this, yep that's right you have access to everything in Botkit AND Discord.js

    // https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/User

    let recipient = message.mentions.users.filter(user => user.bot === false).last();

    

    // this is a list of potential responses, it chooses from them randomly.

    // Try changing them or adding your own. 

    let responses = [

      `${recipient} got kudos from ${sender} 🎉`,

      `${sender} thinks ${recipient} is awesome! ✨`,

      `Hey ${recipient}! ${sender} appreciates you! 😍`,

      `Hey ${recipient}! ${sender} thinks you rule! 💪`

    ]

    response = responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)];

    

    bot.reply(message, response);

  });
